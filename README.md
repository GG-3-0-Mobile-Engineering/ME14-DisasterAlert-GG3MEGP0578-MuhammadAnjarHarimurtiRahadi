DisasterAlert uses the GoogleMaps API to fetch the needed data, so before using it you have to create an account on [Google Maps Platform website](https://mapsplatform.google.com/), then you can get your api key.

- Go to `local.properties`
- Add code like this
```kotlin
MAPS_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX;
```
- Replace the all `XX..` to your own api key.
- Don't forget to rebuild your project after add your api key.
- It's done!
</ul>
